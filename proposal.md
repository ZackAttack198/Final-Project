# Project title
Night Drive


# Description
A screensaver, similar to the digital rain lab, that depicts a looping animation of a flying car driving past a futuristic neon city.


# Features
Looping animation
- The program will run a somewhat simple looping pixel animation of a flying car driving past a city.

Twinkling stars
- The program will randomly spawn small particles in the area representing the sky, which periodically blink.

Fireworks
- By mouse-clicking while the program is running, the user can spawn a firework animation.


# Challenges
- Since I never used this feature for my digital rain lab, I'll have to learn how to program mouse inputs.
- To accomplish what I want, I need to figure out how to create a looping (non-looping for fireworks) animation from a sequence of images that already exists on my computer.
- Furthermore, I'll have to learn how to layer multiple image sequences on top of each other, as I believe the best way to accomplish what I want will be to create two or three separate sequences.
- While the digital rain lab provides a strong basis for the "twinkling stars" idea, it would help if I researched how to randomize their individual twinkles.


# Outcomes

Ideal outcome: A looping animation created from image sequences that already exist on my computer, with randomly twinkling stars in the sky. Users can also left mouse click on the program to spawn a randomly-colored firework animation.

Minimum viable outcome: A looping animation created from image sequences that already exist on my computer, with stars in the sky that twinkle simultaneously. Users can also left mouse click on the program to spawn a red firework animation.


# Milestones

Week 1:
- Using a pixel art app, draw the images for my first sequence, which is of the car on the road.

Week 2:
- Using a pixel art app, draw the images for my second sequence, which is of the city in the background.

Week 3:
- Using a pixel art app, draw the images for my firework animation.

Week 4:
1. Learn how to create looping animations from my drawn images (non-looping for the firework animation).
2. Learn how to layer the animations on top of each other.

Week 5:
1. Create the area of twinkling stars.
2. Learn how to spawn the firework animation via a left mouse click.
